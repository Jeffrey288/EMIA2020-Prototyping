# EMIA2020-Prototyping

*Update:* see `big_tft_test` for tft code

Very, very simple code for proof of concept "debit-card payment system" in wet markets.

(I frequently ask the question: why am I taking this course?

Then I realised. I didn't want to take this course. Its a major requirement.

It makes me rethink university education and the correct way to pursue knowledge.)

Contains:
- code for controlling TFT using arduino
- some self-written code for printing characters out
- uses nearest neighbour to enlarge letter
- using progmem to store large amounts of data and images
- code for printing images out
- use of Keypad library for controlling 4x4 matrix keypad

View the "project" folder for the code.
