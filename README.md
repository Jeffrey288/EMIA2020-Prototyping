# EMIA2020-Prototyping

Very, very simple code for proof of concept "debit-card payment system" in wet markets.

(I frequently ask the question: why am I taking this course?)

Contains:
- code for controlling TFT using arduino
- some self-written code for printing characters out
- uses nearest neighbour to enlarge letters
- using progmem to store large amounts of data
- use of Keypad library for controlling 4x4 matrix keypad
